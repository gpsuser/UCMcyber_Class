**Question 1:**

Network __________ operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model and maintain a table that maps device addresses to specific physical ports. These devices forward data frames based on __________ rather than IP addresses.

---

**Question 2:**

Routers operate at __________ of the OSI model and serve as gateways between different networks, making forwarding decisions based on IP addresses rather than physical addresses.

---

**Question 3:**

Twisted pair Ethernet cables such as Cat5e and Cat6 have a maximum transmission distance of __________, after which signal degradation requires the use of additional network devices to extend connectivity.

---

**Question 4:**

Wireless networks should implement __________ encryption to protect against unauthorised access and data interception, as wireless signals can be intercepted by anyone within range.

---

**Question 5:**

__________ cables transmit data as pulses of light and offer significant advantages including immunity to __________, making them ideal for electrically noisy environments and long-distance transmission.

## Section 3: Extended Response Questions

Answer the following questions in complete sentences. Provide detailed explanations to demonstrate your understanding.

---

**Question 1:**

Explain the difference between a network switch and a network router. Include in your answer: (a) which OSI layer each device operates at, (b) what type of addresses each device uses for forwarding decisions, and (c) the primary purpose of each device in a network infrastructure.

---

**Question 2:**

Compare and contrast wired and wireless connection media in terms of security considerations. Identify at least three security advantages of wired connections and two specific security challenges introduced by wireless networks. Suggest one mitigation strategy for wireless security concerns.

---

**Question 3:**

A small business is planning to upgrade its network infrastructure. The business has 25 employees who work both at fixed desks and in meeting rooms throughout the office. Recommend appropriate network hardware for this scenario, including end user devices, connectivity devices, and connection media.
